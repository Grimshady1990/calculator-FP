# The Frankulator 5000 🧮

Welcome to **The Frankulator 5000** — a delightfully springy, and unapologetically retro calculator, handcrafted as the final project for [The Odin Project Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## 📱 Optimized for Humans (and Their Devices)

The Frankulator 5000 was built with mobile users in mind, so whether you're on the go or just lying on the sofa wondering what 7 × 8 is (it's 56, by the way), you're covered. It works great on desktop too — just zoom in a little if your screen starts throwing a tantrum.

## ✨ Features

* Old-school calculator display vibes
* Soft, springy buttons that scream *click me*
* Handles basic math like a champion (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
* Friendly UI that doesn’t take itself too seriously

## 🤔 Why?

Because math is hard enough — your calculator shouldn't be. Whether you're trying to split the bill or unlock the secrets of the cosmos, **The Frankulator 5000** is your trusty sidekick (cape not included).

## ⚙️ Built With

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* And a lot of caffeine
